//Let's start with an easy one. In this quiz, I'm giving you a main function. All I want you to do is write no more steering wheels to stdout.

#include <iostream>

int main() {
  // write your code here!
  // print "no more steering wheels" to stdout
  std::cout << "no more steering wheels" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
