How many times will this loop execute?

	unsigned char half_limit = 150;

		 for (unsigned char i = 0; i < 2 * half_limit; ++i)
		 {
			 // do something;
		 }
		 
		 
	This code will result in an infinite loop.
	The expression 2 * half_limit will get promoted to an int (based on C++ conversion rules) and will have a value of 300. However, since i is an unsigned char,
	it is rerepsented by an 8-bit value which, after reaching 255, will overflow (so it will go back to 0) and the loop will therefore go on forever.
